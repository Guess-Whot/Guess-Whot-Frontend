### What is Guess Whot? ###

'Guess Whot?' is an app that allows users to add and use a band of pop-culture characters for a zany 'Guess Who?' style game!


### How it Works ###

* Sign In or Sign Up
* You are are in the lobby! Coordinate with other players in the lobby on a room in which you'd like to play! Type the room into the input, click 'Join Room'!
* You are presented with the gameboard and chat, with your opponent already connected.
* First, select a secret character in the bottom right. Let your opponent know when you are ready!
* The game is afoot! Ask your opponent a yes or no question about who you think their secret character is. Their answer will allow you to eliminate characters until you are ready to guess!
* When you are ready, take a stab at who you think their character is!
* Have fun!!
